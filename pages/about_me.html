    <h3>Hello all, and welcome to my website where I will give you an entire rundown of what made me, me!</h3>
    <p><em>This is me, 16 years of age in a London Cable Car.</em></p>
    <div><img id="pic1" src="/assets/ProfilePhoto.JPG" alt="A picture of me!" /> <img id="pic2" src="/assets/IMG-8115.JPG" alt="A picture of me when I was younger!" /> <img id="pic3" src="/assets/IMG-8113.JPG" alt="Another picture of me when I was younger!" /></div>

    <p>Having recently achieved <strong>straight 9s</strong> at GCSE, I have enjoyed the step up to Computer Science, Physics, Maths and Further Maths A-Level. My primary passion is Coding, and my enthusiasm only increases as I gain more knowledge in this ever-evolving discipline.</p>
    <p><br /> I am looking forward to participating in the Gold Duke of Edinburgh scheme this academic year.</p>
    <p><br /> Outside of school, I am a highly committed member of my high-level club football team and I have captained sides at several age grades. I am also an assistant coach for a lower age girls' team within my club. In addition, I enjoy badminton.</p>
    <p><br /> I play the guitar and I love contemporary music. ðŸŽ¸</p>
    <p><br /> I also tutor maths. âž•âž–âž—</p>
    <p><br /> Furthermore, I have been lucky enough to have had the cultural eye-opening experience of living abroad: spending one year in Croatia, one year in Abu Dhabi and six years in Qatar!</p>
